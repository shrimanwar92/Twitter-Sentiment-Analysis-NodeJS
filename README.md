# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-NodeJS

Sentiment analysis helps you in understanding what people think about a certain topic. 
The sentiment analysis app we are going to build will take in a keyword(s) and will fetch the matching tweets from Twitter. 
Then, it will run each tweet through an AFINN powered sentiment analysis Node module. 
This module will score the tweet text, and finally will display the relevant statistics.

This project uses the retext library.
